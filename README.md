-- Me

This project is the solution. It formats videos and puts nice little face masks on each face.

# installation 

before changing the past you'll first need to install some packages with the following command:\
```
pip install moviepy pillow face-recognition
```

# usage

To mask run:\
```
./mask_on.py file
```

To unmask run:\
```
./fuck_it_mask_off.sh file
```

# TODO

- space out the videos so everyone is 6ft apart.
